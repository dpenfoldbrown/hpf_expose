dpb 1/14/2013:

Project to create web resource for exposing all HPF DB elements in a nice 
and EASY web format.

Requires:

Flask python web framework (http://flask.pocoo.org/)
    Uses Flask's SQLAlchemy Extension (http://packages.python.org/Flask-SQLAlchemy/index.html)
    Uses Jinja2 templates (http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/)


Bootstrap javascript/CSS library. Download per site (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
    Uses (and comes with) jQuery


Elements:

Pages for Protein, Domain, Sequence, and Experiment HPF entities. Displays for
each, with interlinking. Links to HPF Blast interfaces. Will also link to PDB
for known domain structures, and:

Basic GLMol embeded structures in place (with lazy loading via iframes). Need to
make GLMol more sophisticated (view controls and style).


Security:

NOTE that *master* branch must always use the Flask production-style app (ie,
never run an app in a production setting with app.debug = True, as it enables
the running of arbitrary python code).

*master* branch has app.debug set to False. 
*dev* branch has app.debug set to True, to allow for auto-reload and debugging
